                    Food functions as the epicenter of my home. When I think back to my early childhood, I remember
                    condensed milk toast. The warm, sticky-soft of the condensed milk-soaked toast is
                    absolutely delicious. When on the table, we would split it and share it. This sense of togetherness
                    and comfort is home.

                <h2>
                    Although I can easily cook my own meals, nothing beats the taste of food made by my family.
                </h2>
                <br>
                <h2> The grilled cheese my dad made in Jan 2023 sparked the idea for this work. My mom and I had just
                    bought sourdough, my sister made garlic
                    confit, and my dad had a craving. The final pan-toasted grilled cheese had
                    smooth garlic and white Kraft American cheese. There was structure, texture, and a gorgeous
                    meltiness.
